        <p>
          Hello, my name is Jacobo Galofre and I am currently a student of the
          Video game development and design bachelor's degree at the CITM-UPC
          university in Barcelona. Throughout this four years I've been studying
          in this degree I've found that my passion and where I want to forge my
          future is In the video game Industry. I am currently willing to find
          somewhere where I can start and develop my career as a game developer
          or a game engine programmer. <br />
          A part from my professional ambitions I really enjoy spending my time
          in the nature, discovering new music and of course playing some games
          with my friends. <br />
          If you are Interested in knowing more about me and my work you can
          download my curriculum vitae or read about the projects I've worked on
          which are documented further down on this page.
