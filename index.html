          Hello, my name is Jacobo Galofre and I am currently a student of the
          Video game development and design bachelor's degree at the CITM-UPC
          university in Barcelona. Throughout this four years I've been studying
          in this degree I've found that my passion and where I want to forge my
          future is In the video game Industry. I am currently willing to find
          somewhere where I can start and develop my career as a game developer
          or a game engine programmer. <br />
          A part from my professional ambitions I really enjoy spending my time
          in the nature, discovering new music and of course playing some games
          with my friends. <br />
          If you are Interested in knowing more about me and my work you can
          download my curriculum vitae or read about the projects I've worked on
          which are documented further down on this page.

            <p>
              Throughout my student career I've worked on several projects where
              I developed my programming skills, I've mainly programmed on
              c/c++/c# but I have also learned and played with other programming
              languages such as lua, glsl, python, matlab, and others. I've
              worked with several IDEs and tools such as visual studio 2019 and
              code, Unity, UE4, etc.

            <p>
              Since I started studying to become a game developer one of the
              things that most attracted me was the idea of creating amazing
              expiriences for people to play, and throughout this 4 years I've
              had the pleasure to learn about game design and improve my skills
              in several projects I've worked on. Although I know I'm still at
              the beginning of a long journey I seek to keep improving and
              mastering my skills as a game designer.

              One of the most importannt skills I got to work on and improve are
              my social skills. Since day one when I started the degree, I
              learned that communication skills are crucial when working with a
              team. That's why during the degree I've done lots of projects
              where I had to work as a team with other collegues and that pushed
              me to improve on this aspect. A part from that I also have learned
              and used agile methodologies like scrum or kanban.
