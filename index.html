        <p>
          Hello, my name is Jacobo Galofre and I am currently a student of the
          Video game development and design bachelor's degree at the CITM-UPC
          university in Barcelona. Throughout this four years I've been studying
          in this degree I've found that my passion and where I want to forge my
          future is In the video game Industry. I am currently willing to find
          somewhere where I can start and develop my career as a game developer
          or a game engine programmer. <br />
          A part from my professional ambitions I really enjoy spending my time
          in the nature, discovering new music and of course playing some games
          with my friends. <br />
          If you are Interested in knowing more about me and my work you can
          download my curriculum vitae or read about the projects I've worked on
          which are documented further down on this page.

            <p>
              Throughout my student career I've worked on several projects where
              I developed my programming skills, I've mainly programmed on
              c/c++/c# but I have also learned and played with other programming
              languages such as lua, glsl, python, matlab, and others. I've
              worked with several IDEs and tools such as visual studio 2019 and
              code, Unity, UE4, etc.

            <p>
              Since I started studying to become a game developer one of the
              things that most attracted me was the idea of creating amazing
              expiriences for people to play, and throughout this 4 years I've
              had the pleasure to learn about game design and improve my skills
              in several projects I've worked on. Although I know I'm still at
              the beginning of a long journey I seek to keep improving and
              mastering my skills as a game designer.

              One of the most importannt skills I got to work on and improve are
              my social skills. Since day one when I started the degree, I
              learned that communication skills are crucial when working with a
              team. That's why during the degree I've done lots of projects
              where I had to work as a team with other collegues and that pushed
              me to improve on this aspect. A part from that I also have learned
              and used agile methodologies like scrum or kanban.

              The Witcher: Ties of Destiny is a 2 Player Coop Hack n Slash game,

              Jaskier to defeat all enemies that dare to face you. Developed by
              Broken Gem Studios with our own OpenGL Game Engine coded from
              scratch in C++.<br />
              I was in charge of implementing the audio module in the engine and
              creating the necessary tools for the gameplay programmers and
              designers. A part from that I was also part of the audio design
              and implementation team and the QA team.

              This project was an Andro Dunos recreation tribute to the original
              side-scrolling shoot'em up game, purely developed in C++ with SDL
              by five students on our first year. With the possibilities of both
              playing it as a single player or cooperative game, the players
              take the control of a spaceship that faces different threats and a
              final boss that has to overcome in order to achieve victory.<br />
              As it was a recreation of the game most of the work I did for the
              project was to document all the improtant information from the
              original game and also program the game systems and gameplay
              needed.

              Torpedo Inbound is a Game Jam project made by 5 students during
              the 2nd CITM Game Jam. It is a submarine shooter game in the
              depths of the ocean that was developed with the Unity 2D Engine
              and the Tiled Map Editor. In it the player confronts treacherous
              sea mines and other submarines.<br />This project was the first
              game jam for all of the members of the team as well as it was the
              first time that most of us used a game engine like unity, even
              though this difficulties we were able to achieve a pretty solid
              game in under 24 hours.

              Radical Encounter is a God Game made with Unity in which the

              their little village against a series of different enemy soldiers.
              They are going to attack them and also damage the buildings and
              the infrastructure of the place, so you will have both to assist
              the people and repair the patrimony, all with the help of the
              resources you will acquire by slaining and saving your comrades.
              We programmed the artifficial intelligence and the behaviour of
              all the characters.

              Fantasy Brawl is a Battle Royale game developed by CheckTheDog
              that features intense action in a PvP map. Each player is in
              control of a totally different hero each with its own
              characteristics and special ability. Every round won gives the
              player 3 stars, Win the most stars after 4 rounds and you'll
              become the winner.<br />In this project I was in charge of the
              design of the game but at the end of the day, every one on the
              team worked in what we needed and ended up working more as a
              programmer than as a designer.

              Breakout Lab is a Game Jam project done by a group of 5 people
              under 30 hours. It's a puzzle game were the player gets to play as
              a scientist who's trapped in a lab were everyone has become a
              zombie. The player will have to get through all the rooms to scape
              from the lab, to do so it will be necessary to cure all the
              zombies in each room using different medicines.<br />For this
              project I was the main level designer as well as game designer, I
              also implemented the menus and UI for the game and helped with
              several code issues that came up during the development.

              Dungeon called “Do it for the Beast”. It was fully developed with
              all the knowledge acquired on player guidance and level design to
              achieve a believable world while being challenging for the player
              and as a released game level. This project was developed by a
              teammate and me, thinking on the design of the rooms and the
              different zones in the level, by maintaining the lore of the one
              page dungeon.
